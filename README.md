# My First Web Page

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/ca740098-ce24-45b9-bf56-cea77f3d13ad/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/my-first-web-page-project/deploys)

Welcome to the repository of my very first web page! This project is a stepping stone into the vast world of web development, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Inspiration

The format and structure of this web page are inspired by the comprehensive and beginner-friendly [HTML Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA) by Dave Gray. His tutorials provided clear guidance and best practices that I've incorporated into my work.

## What I Learned

- **HTML Basics**: Starting with the structure of an HTML document, I learned to define the skeleton of a web page using the `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
- **Semantic HTML**: I used semantic HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` to create a well-structured and accessible page.
- **Content Creation**: I added various types of content, including text, images, and links, using tags like `<p>`, `<img>`, and `<a>`.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the web page looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Accessibility**: Implementing features for screen readers and keyboard navigation to make the web page more accessible to all users.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Testing the web page across different browsers for consistent performance.

## Setup

To view this web page:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
