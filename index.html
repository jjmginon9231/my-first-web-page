    <h2>I'm Also Planning a Getaway</h2>
    <p>I've been working diligently and <em>definitely deserve a vacation.</em></p>
    <p>I live in <abbr title="Manila">MNL</abbr> and would like to go to take a dip in a hot spring.</p>

    <h3>Places I'd Like To Travel To</h3>
    <p>I've' heard amazing reviews about Japan's hot springs.</p>
    <p>I've been told excellent reviews regarding visiting here:</p>
    <address>
        Hakone Yuryo<br>
        4 Tonosawa, Hakone, <br>
        Ashigarashimo District, <br>
        Kanagawa 250-0315, Japan
    </address>

    <!-- TODO: Add more places here -->
    <h3>Places I'd Prefer to Avoid</h3>
    <p>Any place with harsh temperatures. <strong>No way!</strong></p>
